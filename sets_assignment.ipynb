Print the set.\n\n### Assignment 2: Adding and Removing Elements\n\nAdd the number 11 to the set created in Assignment 1. Then remove the number 1 from the set. Print the modified set.\n\n### Assignment 3: Set Operations\n\nCreate two sets: one with the first 5 positive integers and another with the first 5 even integers. Perform and print the results of union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference operations on these sets.\n\n### Assignment 4: Set Comprehensions\n\nCreate a new set containing the squares of the first 10 positive integers using a set comprehension. Print the new set.\n\n### Assignment 5: Filtering Sets\n\nCreate a new set containing only the even numbers from the set created in Assignment 1 using a set comprehension. Print the new set.\n\n### Assignment 6: Set Methods\n\nCreate a set with duplicate elements and remove the duplicates using set methods. Print the modified set.\n\n### Assignment 7: Subsets and Supersets\n\nCreate two sets: one with the first 5 positive integers and another with the first 3 positive integers. Check if the second set is a subset of the first set and if the first set is a superset of the second set. Print the results.\n\n### Assignment 8: Frozenset\n\nCreate a frozenset with the first 5 positive integers. Print the frozenset.\n\n### Assignment 9: Set and List Conversion\n\nCreate a set with the first 5 positive integers. Convert it to a list, append the number 6, and convert it back to a set. Print the resulting set.\n\n### Assignment 10: Set and Dictionary\n\nCreate a dictionary with set keys and integer values. Print the dictionary.\n\n### Assignment 11: Iterating Over Sets\n\nCreate a set and iterate over the elements, printing each element.\n\n### Assignment 12: Removing Elements from Sets\n\nCreate a set and remove elements from it until it is empty. Print the set after each removal.\n\n### Assignment 13: Set Symmetric Difference Update\n\nCreate two sets and update the first set with the symmetric difference of the two sets. Print the modified first set.\n\n### Assignment 14: Set Membership Testing\n\nCreate a set and test if certain elements are present in the set. Print the results.\n\n### Assignment 15: Set of Tuples\n\nCreate a set containing tuples, where each tuple contains two elements. Print the set.",
